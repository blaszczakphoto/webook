  <p>It's heaving. Dogs barking, children squealing, yellow cabs fighting for spaces. We meet our guide, Leonardo: "Welcome to Ecuador" and he flashes a brilliant white smile. Welcome indeed.

We're 9,000ft above sea level in the second highest city in the world. It's hot, the sun is bright and we need to acclimatise - take it slow and drink lots of liquids. A local beer calls for attention, but a freshly squeezed blackberry juice is handed to me. Oh!

Quito is a long, narrow city sprawling 30 miles through the Andes valley. There's mixture of old and new. Touches of Spanish influence on every corner, and from our Hilton hotel we get a fabulous view - houses crammed on the slopes; the twin spires of the ancient neo-Gothic Basilica, and the statue of the Apocalyptic Virgin (Winged Madonna) on the summit of the Panecillo Hill. It's like a mini Rio in pastel shades.

We stay awake for a spectacular sunset when the hills set on fire, changing hues minute by minute. Darkness falls, the night-city awakes and sleep beckons.

A long, but great first day. More installments to follow.</p>
